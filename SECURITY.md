## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication for secure user management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Cashier, Viewer)
- JWT token validation
- Session management

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Firestore
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure headers implementation
- Environment variable protection
- Firebase security rules

### Code Security
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint security rules
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security updates

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the application updated to the latest version
4. **Access Control**: Limit user permissions to minimum required
5. **Data Backup**: Regularly backup your data
6. **Secure Environment**: Use HTTPS and secure hosting environments

## Firebase Security Rules

Ensure your Firebase security rules are properly configured:

```javascript
// Example Firestore security rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Only authenticated users can access business data
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Vulnerability Response

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Fix Development**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched within 7 days
4. **Release**: Security patches will be released as soon as possible
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter
