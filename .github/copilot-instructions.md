# Copilot Instructions

This document provides guidelines for using GitHub Copilot effectively in this Next.js financial tracking application project.

## Purpose
The goal is to leverage GitHub Copilot to enhance development speed and code quality by providing AI-assisted code suggestions and completions.

## How to Use Copilot
1. **Enable Copilot**: Ensure GitHub Copilot is enabled in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. **Contextual Suggestions**: Write comments or function signatures to guide Copilot in generating relevant code.
3. **Review Suggestions**: Always review the suggestions provided by Copilot to ensure they meet project standards and requirements.
4. **Iterate**: If the initial suggestion isn't satisfactory, provide more context or modify your input to refine the output.

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive comments to help Copilot understand the context of the code you are writing.
- Break down complex functions into smaller, manageable pieces to get better suggestions.
- Regularly commit changes and test the code generated by Copilot to ensure functionality aligns with expectations.
